# Metadata Discovery Model

**Cafe Variome V3** can consume, store, serve, and query metadata both locally or as part of a federated network. This guide explains the model of metadata that CV3 accepts, and the principles behind using metadata functions.

## Concept of metadata

Generally, metadata refers to the "data about data." For example, information about a dataset, or about a record inside a dataset. In CV3, the definition is slightly different - metadata refers to the general information on a data collection, either inside of CV3 or hosted somewhere else. The information about a subject does not differentiate between data and metadata, and is all stored inside a data source. Examples of metadata include:

- Name, email or address of the contacting PI
- Name, email or URL for the data publisher
- The license this dataset is released under
- The use conditions or agreement for the data

In general, any information about a collection of data, including dataset, catalog, cohort, etc. can be stored in CV3. This is done via a concept called **Meta Source**.

## Meta sources

A meta-source is a single document representing a dataset or a collection of subject records. Internally, it's stored directly within the corresponding collection of subject records (or dataset) in the database.

The meta-source can link to a dataset inside CV3, meaning that the metadata recorded is for that data source. Alternatively, the meta-source may refer to a dataset outside the system, meaning that the admininistators of the installation are aware of the data, have metadata about it, but cannot or are unwilling to host the data in CV3.

In principle, the metadata recorded in the system is open for discovery, where no authentication is necessary for accessing them. All formats generated by CV3 for these metadata (for example, a <tooltip term="FAIR">FAIR</tooltip> Data Point) will also be
open to the public.

### Meta source types

Meta-sources are designed to be flexible, and can contain extra information with custom fields. There are also pre-defined meta-source models, which fit commonly used metadata models for a given resource type. They can be selected according to the type of data being described, and/or the metadata collected.

We currently have the following pre-defined metadata models:

- **EPND Cohort**: The cohort model used by the [European Platform for Neurodegenerative Disease](https://epnd.org/) to register their collaborative cohorts. An official catalog of cohorts can be found at [EPND Cohort Catalog](https://discover.epnd.org/).
- **Dataset**: A collection of **records** that have been collected for a defined purpose, such as to answer a specific research question. Datasets are atomic, meaning that they cannot be further divided into smaller datasets. As such, all requests and permissions granted apply to the entire dataset.
- **Data collection**: A collection of **datasets** that have been collated for a common purpose, but which can be further divided into smaller collections. For example, all data is collected as part of a given research programme or within a given consortium. Users are only expected to be granted partial access, and hence typically will only request access to a subset of a data collection.
- **Catalog**: A collection of **datasets** and/or **data collections**. Nesting of catalogues is permitted, meaning it is possible to create a "catalog of catalogs."
- **Biobank**: A collection of biological samples (and associated data) collected from patients. These collections are usually based on a certain criteria, for example, a disease or a geographical location.
- **Registry**: A patient registry containing information about patients, usually clinical information, but any information about patients can be stored in a registry.
- **Guideline**: A collection of one or more guidelines for processes relating to a certain disease or a type of data collection.
- **Custom**: This is a general type, and can be used to describe any type of data collection that is not covered in the above types.

> The type of meta-source is used in several places to filter and describe the result. Hence, it is imperative to ensure that the type is correctly assigned. For example, a special collection of records may resemble a dataset, but may be different from a traditional understanding of a dataset. In this case, the custom type should be selected instead of selecting one that resembles the data type.

#### Relationship between meta sources

Meta-sources can be related to each other, forming a hierarchy or a graph of metadata. Like the following diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
MetaSource <|-- Catalog
MetaSource <|-- Cohort
MetaSource <|-- Dataset
MetaSource <|-- DataCollection

Cohort "0..*" o-- "0..1" Dataset
Cohort "0..*" o-- "0..1" DataCollection
@enduml
```

#### Relationship between meta sources and data sources

Meta sources are designed to store metadata. Thus, internally, they can be linked to record level data stored in regular data sources, mainly with the "**belong to**" relationship.

## The Basic model

The structure of the metadata follows a general model. The basic model is used in all cases and is then extended to accommodate other types of data with more detailed fields.

<snippet id="section-internal_fields_and_manual_assignment">

### Internal fields and manual assignment

The fields explained in the sections below are the fields that form the metadata about a given resource. However, there are several other fields used internally within Cafe Variome to enable specific features, like interlinking of metadata entries. These are not visible when using the editing interface,  but may be manually assigned providing the data is **accurate**, and the admin **conforms to the required processes to format them correctly**.

<deflist collapsible="true">
    <def title="sourceId">
        The UUID of the source. If omitted, Cafe Variome will assign a UUID to the source. If present, it should be a valid <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis-11.html#name-uuid-version-4">UUID4 string</a>. This is used within each Cafe Variome instance to identify the source (UUID may not be unique accross instances). It can be used to link one metadata entry to another, for example, by filling the <code>datasetIds</code> fields in the cohort model.
    </def>
    <def title="connectionId">
        The UUID of a <b>data source</b> this metadata entry describes. This is usually only valid when the metadata describes a dataset, but in rare cases can be assigned to other metadata. This field is not recommended to assign directly, as there is no other way to know the UUID of a data source except from checking the database.
    </def>
</deflist>

> Assigning `sourceId` and `connectionId` manually can lead to data inconsistency, and should be done with caution. Always make sure the IDs are present before adding them to the metadata file. If there are only a few IDs to assign, it's better to do it manually in the editing interface.

### Common fields definition

These are the fields that are present in all types of meta-sources.

<deflist collapsible="true">
    <def title="sourceId">
        Source ID is a UUID4 compatible code generated by the system. However, if the inputted metadata contains some form of hierarchical structure and the ID is used to denote the parent-child relationship, the ID may be included in a manual uploading file. It must be unique and in UUID4 format for the system to accept it.

</deflist>

### Basic model example

The basic model, aka the *Custom* type, expects the following fields:

<include from="library.md" element-id="json-meta_source_custom-maximum"></include>

This metadata model is also used in other meta-source types, where the metadata is similar or same in structure.

## EPND project extensions

### Cohort

#### Cohort fields definition

The cohort model extends the base model to contain more information, specifically the ones deemed necessary in the EPND project. Aside from the fields explained above, it can also have:
