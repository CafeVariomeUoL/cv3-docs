# Authorisation

Cafe Variome, being a decentralised data discovery system, uses a mixed authorisation model that allows the admin to have full control over the user permissions, whether the user can be authenticated or not. This section explains the design of the authorisation model, as well as its operation. In practical situations, remember to adhere to the minimum privilege requirements, granting only necessary access to users.
